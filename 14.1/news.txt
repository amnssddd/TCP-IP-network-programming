My favorite season is autumn. The weather is cool and comfortable, and the leaves turn beautiful shades of red, orange, and yellow. 
I love walking in the park and listening to the sound of rustling leaves under my feet.
Autumn is also a season of harvest. Farmers gather crops, and we can enjoy delicious fruits like apples and pears. 
The Mid-Autumn Festival, when families reunite and eat mooncakes, makes this season even more special.
I enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of autumn. It is neither too hot nor too cold, making it perfect for outdoor activities. 
Every year, I look forward to this wonderful season!
